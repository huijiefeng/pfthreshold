# High-dimensional linear threshold estimation

This is the path-following algorithm proposed in Feng, Huijie, Yang Ning, and Jiwei Zhao. "Nonregular and Minimax Estimation of Individualized Thresholds in High Dimension with Binary Responses." arXiv preprint arXiv:1905.10888 (2019).

Please see the jupyter notebook `Guide.ipynb` for a brief tutorial about the usage of this algorithm. If you have additional question, please refer to the original paper or contact <hf279@cornell.edu>.
